EulerDB
=======

EulerDB is a Graph Database, and it started with a story about connecting the dots. Steve Jobs said "you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future". So mine are about 3 dots.

Dot 1: Robotics and AI

It's my passion towards Robotics brought me to Computer Science. And Natural Language Processing and semantic network marks this first dot.

Dot 2: Interest and Experience

I happend to code the CNC/CAM system for a commercial project in my college, which required lots of Graph knowledge. And I don't know which is chicken, which is egg, but I was also doing good in the graph part for both database and algorithm at schoool.

Dot 3: Graph Database (GD) or Google's Devil

Google lusted me for an Interview. Thus I read some books about some profound topics on Graph. While I was waiting for the result, I made a prototype of this project. After a long wait, I got declined, but I think it would be a good idea to connect the dots.

So this would be a graph database with a focus of knowledge representation.
